This section explains how to set up and run the MSight system on different environments, depending on your use case and available resources.

## 🧰 Installation Methods

You can install MSight in two main ways:

### 1. Local Installation

Use this method if you want to:
- Run MSight components directly on your local development machine.
- Test individual modules
- Deploy MSight on a storage-compact machine
- Develop MSight system, modify the source code, debug, or extend the system.

➡️ See: [Local Installation](local.md)

### 2. Docker-based Installation

Use this method if you prefer a **containerized, reproducible deployment** that works across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), or you have difficulties on setting up your local environment correctly.  
This setup is recommended for production or server environments.

➡️ See: [Docker Installation](docker.md)
